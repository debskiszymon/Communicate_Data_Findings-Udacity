## by Szymon Debski


## Ford Go Bike - trip data

> The data set is the Ford Go Bike trip data. The data was collected in February 2019 in San Francisco Bay Area. The data set I will be using has over 18 hundred records and information such as (trip duration, sex, user type, date of birth). All the analysis presented below is based on this data after it has been wrangled.


## Summary of Findings

> Most people using the bike rental service are Subscribers 90.7% the rest are random customers 9.3%.

> During the working week proportionally subscribers used the service more, however, on the weekend regular (random) customers used it proportionally more often. This means that on the weekend many casual bike riders use the service and people that use it during the week for commuting don't use the service as often.

> The hour at which the bikes are rented is also interesting. We can see that people mostly use the bikes around 8 AM and 5 PM. This indicates that the main way people use the bike is for commuting.

> Female bike riders tend to rent the bike for longer. Also, the youngest people rent the bike for longer periods. However, one interesting thing to note is that people that are older than 50 years tend to rent the bike for longer periods compared to 30 - 50-year-olds. This is a very interesting observation which may indicate the people after 50 use the bike more for exercise as a fitness tool as opposed to a commuting tool. Also, people over 50 years old may have more time for leisure activities.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The main two user types - subscribers and customers - differ a lot in how they use the bike rental service. Subscribers mainly use the bike on weekdays during rush hours presumably for commuting. On the other hand, Customers tend to use the service more on the weekends throughout the day. Another difference is for how long they use the bike - Subscribers use it for short periods - to get from point A to B. However Customers rent the bike on average for longer periods as it is used for leisure presumably with no specific destination in mind.
